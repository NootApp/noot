# Noot
A (first attempt at a) desktop editor for Markdown files, with workspace sync, 
automagic backups, and a nice twist on the traditional text editor.



### Security

This is not currently meant to be used in any context which may require or expect a 
level of security higher than that of an open network.

Treat all security features as if they are nonfunctional, even if they work.

This project has not been audited for security in any way, and the original 
implementations are not designed to be foolproof.
